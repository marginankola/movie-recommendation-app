## Description ðŸ’¬

This React app is a movie search and watchlist manager. Users can search for movies using the OMDb API, see a list of results, and add movies to a "watched" list with personal ratings. The app also tracks movie details such as IMDb ratings, runtime, and user ratings. Users can delete movies from the watchlist and view a summary of all watched movies, including average IMDb ratings and runtime. Key features include dynamic updates, asynchronous movie fetching, and keyboard shortcuts for improved user experience.
